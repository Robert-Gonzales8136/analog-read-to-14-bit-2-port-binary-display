# analog-read-to-14-bit-2-port-binary-display
An analog value is fed into A0 and is mapped to a 14 bit value and displayed on 14 LEDs on ports D and B on an Arduino Uno. This code was designed to optimize memory and run speed by using the smallest variables that fit, using bit fields, and avoiding expensive functions.
