/*
This code maps an analog 10 bit value from A0 to a 14 binary bit value displayed on 14 LEDs on port D0-D8 and port B0-B6.
The defined function is a macro to make masks to access specific bits on a port. OR with a mask will set bit X and NAND with a mask will clear bit X.
Bit masking is to guarantee that unused bits are not changed.
The unions are bit fields that are a full word long. The 2 most significant bits are unused on port B so they're unknown, unnamed, unchanged and PB is specified as a partial port.
When the port values are loaded into a word, 6 bits of port B are shifted one byte and added to the full port D.
Bit masking and bit field techniques taken from the LinkedIn Learning tutorial "C Programming for Embedded Applications" by Eduardo Corpe√±o.
